# Project Context for Claude Code

## Custom Commands

When the user says "give feedback", interpret this as:
"Give critical suggestions, point out wrong if there's any, give fix and suggestions on how to prevent it next time. Encourage me if everything is correct."

This means:
1. Analyze the code for correctness and logic errors
2. Identify potential issues or improvements
3. Provide specific fixes with code examples
4. Suggest best practices to prevent similar issues
