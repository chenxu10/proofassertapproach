Why databases is the most important?

Things go wrong can go wrong about state.

State should be about database.

Too flexible.

Adds complexity to application code.

Performance issue.

Entity, relationship, fields and indexs(more than a few rows) should be human readable.

Make things do in database as much as you can. Join them. Do not them things in memory.
