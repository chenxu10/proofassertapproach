    - Backtrack function uses only 2 parameters (position tuple, word_index)
    - State encapsulation reduces cognitive load following cognitive laws
    - Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability

    1. Early termination when character doesn't match
    2. Boundary checking before recursion
    3. Visited cell tracking to avoid cycles
    4. Character frequency pruning (if word has more of a char than board)
