"""
Test cases for Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum problem based on constructive proof approach.

The Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum problem: Given a binary tree, find the maximum 
path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.

Test cases are designed to verify proof requirements:
1. Correctness: Solution finds the actual maximum path sum
2. Completeness: Handles all tree structures (linear, balanced, single node, etc.)
3. Termination: Algorithm terminates for all finite binary trees
4. Edge cases: Negative values, single nodes, empty trees
5. Path validity: Ensures paths are valid (connected nodes)
