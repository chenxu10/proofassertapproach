# STRONG STAR EXAMPLE:
## Situation
"I was leading development of a triage system for XXX - essentially an AI-based routing system to connect XX with the XXXX when they had questions. The original scope was just smart routing."

## Task: 
"My task was to deliver a system that would route inquiries efficiently to the appropriate legal teams within the agreed timeline and budget."

## Action: 
"However, during user testing, I discovered that people weren't just frustrated with getting routed to the wrong XXX - they were frustrated with waiting for answers to basic questions they'd seen before. Rather than just delivering the routing system as specified, I took initiative to analyze three months of inquiry data using the Pareto principle. I identified that 20% of question types represented 80% of all inquiries. I then built an automated response system with actionable guidance for these common questions, and got stakeholder buy-in by showing them the potential time savings."

##Result: 
"The enhanced system now automatically resolves 30% of all inquiries instantly, compared to 0% before. This freed up XX hours per week of XXX time that could be redirected to strategic work. User satisfaction scores increased from XX to XXX out of 10, and average response time dropped from X hours to under XX minutes for common questions."
