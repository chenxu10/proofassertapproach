"""
Test cases for Two Sum problem based on constructive proof approach.

The Two Sum problem: Given an array of integers and a target sum, 
find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.

Test cases are designed to verify proof requirements:
1. Correctness: Solution finds valid pair when it exists
2. Completeness: Solution handles all possible scenarios
3. Termination: Algorithm terminates in all cases
4. Uniqueness: Handles cases with multiple valid pairs
5. Edge cases: Empty arrays, no solution, duplicate values
